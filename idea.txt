I need a free, safe place to host a streamlit app. The software that I sell pushes out data via a webhook and I want to be able to show this data off on a webui. I'm picking streamlit because it's easiest to create but flask might be better because flask offers an API endpoint easily. Below is the payload that will be sent. We can discuss that payload and the functionality of the site later, right now I need your help finding a place to host this site

{"type":"DATA_ACCESS_REQUEST","payload":{"asset_details":{"guid":"b178a72f-e1a5-4326-a1ac-f6b091b4d4dd","name":"INSTACART_CUSTOMER_DETAILS","qualified_name":"default/snowflake/1663703816/DBT_FOOD_BEVERAGE/POSTGRES_RDS_DEMO/INSTACART_CUSTOMER_DETAILS","url":"https://snowflake-partner.atlan.com/assets/b178a72f-e1a5-4326-a1ac-f6b091b4d4dd/overview","type_name":"Table","connector_name":"snowflake","database_name":"DBT_FOOD_BEVERAGE","schema_name":"POSTGRES_RDS_DEMO"},"request_timestamp":"2025-06-27T19:58:53Z","approval_details":{"is_auto_approved":false,"approvers":[{"name":"gene.arnold","comment":"You got it!","approved_at":"2025-06-27T19:59:58Z","email":"gene.arnold@atlan.com"}]},"requestor":"gene.arnold","requestor_email":"gene.arnold@atlan.com","requestor_comment":"","forms":[{"form_title":"Data Access Request","response":{"Dataset":"Dataset please"}}]}}

Great use case—and you're right that Streamlit is super easy for quick WebUIs, but Flask is better if you need custom API endpoints (like to receive and process webhooks). You can even combine both: Flask for API, Streamlit for UI—if hosted correctly.

✅ Your Requirement
Host a free, safe, public-facing app.

Support receiving a webhook (which implies HTTP POST support).

Show data on a Streamlit UI.

Optional: support multiple payloads and save data for visualization.

🔍 Hosting Options
Here are your best free and safe options:

1. Render (https://render.com) ✅ Best balance for Flask or Streamlit
Free tier: Yes (750 hours/month)

Webhook support: Yes (Flask works well)

Streamlit support: Yes (via render.yaml config)

Custom domain: Yes

Background workers / cron jobs: Yes (limited)

💡 You can host Flask or Streamlit, or both using gunicorn. Their platform spins down after inactivity (but reactivates on access).

2. Railway (https://railway.app) ✅ Easy Flask support
Free tier: Yes (~500 hours/month + $5 credit)

Webhook support: Yes (Flask is easy)

Streamlit support: Possible, though better suited for Flask

Database support: Yes (PostgreSQL)

💡 Ideal if you need quick deployments and a generous free tier.

3. Hugging Face Spaces (https://huggingface.co/spaces) ✅ Streamlit only
Free tier: Yes (for public projects)

Streamlit support: ✅ Natively supported

Webhook support: ❌ Not directly (no persistent POST endpoints)

💡 If you're only showing data, Spaces is great. But it’s not good for receiving webhooks directly.

4. Fly.io (https://fly.io) ✅ Advanced users
Free tier: Yes (~3 VMs)

Webhook support: Yes

Streamlit or Flask: Yes (Docker required)

Persistent storage: Requires setup

💡 More setup than Render/Railway, but very flexible and performant. If you're okay using Docker, it's worth trying.

🛠️ Recommendation Based on Your Use Case
Use Case	Best Host
Webhook support + Streamlit UI	Render (Streamlit or Flask or both)
Simple webhook + API only	Railway (Flask)
Just public UI to view data	Hugging Face Spaces (Streamlit only)

✅ Next Steps
Let’s pick Render if you want:

A public UI (Streamlit)

A /webhook endpoint (Flask)

Simple deployment via GitHub

I can then help you:

Create a minimal Flask + Streamlit app

Show how to deploy to Render

Create the GitHub repo + config files

Test with your payload

Would you like to go with Render + combined Flask/Streamlit app? Or do you prefer keeping them separate (API in Flask, UI in Streamlit)?








You said:
if we are only using flask for the API part of the site and not for the UI then I would recommend we us fastapi. Yes / No?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, 100% agree. If you're only using Flask for the API, and not for the UI, then FastAPI is the better choice. Here's why:

✅ Why Use FastAPI Over Flask for Your Webhook/API
Feature	Flask	FastAPI
Async support	Manual & clunky	✅ Native and clean
Type hints	❌ Optional & not used well	✅ Built-in & enforced
API docs (Swagger)	❌ Needs extensions (e.g. flasgger)	✅ Built-in (Swagger + Redoc)
Performance	Moderate	✅ Faster out of the box
Data validation	❌ Manual	✅ Automatic via Pydantic
Learning curve	Easier for total beginners	✅ Still beginner-friendly

✅ FastAPI is Ideal For:
Webhooks (handles JSON beautifully)

Creating structured APIs quickly

Auto-generating documentation (handy for testing incoming webhooks)

Future-proofing for async tasks (e.g. writing to a DB or file in background)

Suggested Stack for Your Project:
FastAPI: for receiving and storing webhook payloads

Streamlit: for displaying the stored payloads/data

SQLite or JSON file (for now): to store incoming webhook data

Render.com: to host both apps (FastAPI API + Streamlit frontend)

If that sounds good, I can now help you:

Set up a FastAPI /webhook endpoint

Store incoming JSON to disk or DB

Serve Streamlit separately to visualize the data

Ready to start building that FastAPI webhook endpoint?

# Project Hosting Plan: Webhook API + Streamlit UI

## ✅ Project Overview

You want to:
- Receive **webhook payloads** from your software product.
- Display the incoming data in a **simple WebUI**.
- Use **Streamlit** for the frontend because it’s fast and easy.
- Use an API backend (Flask or FastAPI) to **receive the webhook**.

## ✅ Payload Example

✅ Framework Decision
You Asked:
If we’re only using Flask for the API and not the UI, should we switch to FastAPI?

✅ Answer: Yes — Use FastAPI instead of Flask
Why FastAPI is Better for API-Only Use:

Feature	Flask	FastAPI
Async support	Limited	✅ Native & high-perf
Type hints	❌ Not required	✅ Strongly encouraged
Auto docs (Swagger)	❌ Extension needed	✅ Built-in
JSON validation	Manual	✅ Pydantic-based

✅ Next Steps
Set up a FastAPI project with a /webhook endpoint to receive the payload.

Store incoming payloads to file or SQLite.

Set up a Streamlit app to read and display that data.

Host both apps on Render (separately or together).

Let’s start with the FastAPI webhook app?

Would you like me to now generate the folder structure and initial `main.py` and `requirements.txt` files for FastAPI deployment on Render?
